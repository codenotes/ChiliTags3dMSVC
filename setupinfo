Need opencd installed to c:\lib (use 2.4 exe install, not the zip)
and you need pthreads implementation, found here: 
ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release.zip

also installed to lib. 

Also, in terms of the the dependencies and DLLS, make certain you are using debug versions of openCV libraries you get
violations and bad data.
